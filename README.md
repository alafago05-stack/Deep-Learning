This repo is me learning multiple deep learning models and the basics of deep learning .
This repo shows multiple models i made on each type of deep learning models i found,
there is also a final project where i develop an automated model that accurately classifies
aircraft damage from images. By the end of the project, you will have trained and evaluated
a model that utilizes feature extraction from VGG16 for damage classification. This model 
will be applicable in real-world damage detection within the aviation industry. Furthermore,
the project will showcase how we can use a Transformer-based model to caption and summarize images,
providing a detailed description of the damage.
